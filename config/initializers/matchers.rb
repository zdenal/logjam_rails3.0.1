# This module contains methods to extract information out of log lines.
# A matcher method must exhibit the following behavior:
#
#   accept a log line and extract info as a hash where the domain corresponds to som db column.
#   return false (or nil) if the line cannot be matched.
#
# NOTE: Most of the configuration options are at the end of this file. But you also need
#       to pay attention to the LOG_LINE_SPLITTER.

# CONFIGURATION
#
# Have you checked LOG_LINE_SPLITTER around line 37?
#
# Make sure to enable matchers appropriate for the log files that will be imported.
# The sample log file included with LogJam is in basic time bandit format.
# It is ok to have multiple COMPLETED matchers enabled; the first to match will be used.
