# The three categories of resources (time, call, and memory) are fixed, but within each category you 
# are free to monitor whatever resources you wish. The names must correspond to the database columns
# defined for the controller_actions table, and the color specifications are used for plotting.

# Within each category the order is significant. The items will appear in menus, plots, and tables
# in this order.
